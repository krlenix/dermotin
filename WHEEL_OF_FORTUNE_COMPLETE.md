## 🎯 What Was Built

I've successfully created a complete, reusable Wheel of Fortune component with all the requested features:

### ✨ Core Features
- **🎰 Interactive Wheel**: Beautiful 3D spinning wheel with realistic physics

  - First spin: Customer almost wins (builds tension)
  - Second spin: Appears to lose but wins at the end (surprise win)
- **🎊 Confetti Effect**: Custom particle animation on win
- **🎉 Congratulations Modal**: Slide-down modal with coupon code and win amount
- **⏰ Popup Timer**: Opens automatically after 5 seconds
- **🔧 Easy Toggle**: Simple environment variable to enable/disable

### 🎨 Design & Animation
- **Modern 3D Effects**: CSS transform perspective and depth
- **Elegant Animations**: Smooth easing and realistic deceleration
- **Shadcn Styling**: Consistent with your existing design system
- **Mobile Responsive**: Adapts beautifully to all screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support, keyboard navigation, focus trapping

### 🔧 Reusable Architecture
- **Configurable Variables**: Everything separated into config files
- **Multiple Themes**: E-commerce, restaurant, service business presets
- **Environment Control**: Easy enable/disable for production/testing
- **TypeScript**: Fully typed for better development experience

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. **Quick Test** (Already Integrated!)
The wheel is already integrated into your landing page. Just run your development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Wait 5 seconds on the homepage and the wheel will appear!

### 2. **Easy Toggle**
Create a `.env.local` file to control the wheel:

```env
# Disable the wheel completely
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHEEL_ENABLED=false

# Or customize timing
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHEEL_DELAY=3000  # 3 seconds instead of 5
```

### 3. **Development Mode**
In development, you'll see dev controls in the bottom-right to:
- Force show the wheel
- Reset storage (show again)
- Test different scenarios

## 🎛️ Configuration Options

### Themes Available
- **E-commerce**: Discount percentages and coupon codes
- **Restaurant**: Free meals, appetizers, drinks
- **Service**: Consultations and service discounts

### Animation Presets
- **Quick**: Fast-paced for impatient users
- **Normal**: Balanced timing
- **Dramatic**: Longer suspense for maximum impact

### Color Schemes
- **Golden**: Warm gold and orange (current)
- **Modern**: Cool blues and grays
- **Vibrant**: Bright energetic colors
- **Elegant**: Dark sophisticated palette
- **Casino**: Classic red and gold

## 🎯 Behavior Logic

### First Spin
- Customer spins wheel
- Wheel stops just short of the grand prize
- Creates tension and "almost won" feeling
- Shows message encouraging second spin

### Second Spin
- Wheel spins again
- Briefly stops at "Try Again" (fake loss)
- After short pause, continues to winning prize
- Triggers confetti and congratulations modal

}
```

## 🚀 Deployment Ready

### For Vercel
1. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
2. Deploy normally - everything is configured

### Environment Variables for Production
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHEEL_ENABLED=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHEEL_DELAY=5000
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHEEL_SHOW_ONCE=true
```

## 📈 Analytics Integration

The wheel emits events that you can track:
- `wheel_shown` - When popup appears
- `wheel_first_spin` - First spin completed
- `wheel_second_spin` - Second spin completed  
- `wheel_prize_won` - Prize won with details
- `wheel_coupon_generated` - Coupon code created

## 🔍 Testing Scenarios

1. **First Time User**: Sees wheel after 5 seconds, experiences almost-win then win sequence
2. **Returning User**: Won't see wheel again (respects localStorage)
3. **Mobile User**: Responsive design, touch-friendly interactions
4. **Accessibility**: Screen reader compatible, keyboard navigable
