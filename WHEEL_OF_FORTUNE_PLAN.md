# Wheel of Fortune Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create a reusable wheel of fortune component that can be used across multiple sites with configurable variables. The wheel will have specific behavior patterns and elegant 3D animations.

## Requirements Analysis
1. **JavaScript-based wheel of fortune** with rotation animation
2. **Specific behavior pattern**:
   - First spin: Customer almost wins (close call)
   - Second spin: Appears to lose but wins at the end
3. **Post-win effects**:
   - Confetti animation
   - Slide-down congratulations div with coupon code and win amount
4. **Popup modal** that opens after 5 seconds on landing page
5. **Easy to disable** for testing purposes
6. **Reusable across sites** with configurable variables
7. **Modern, elegant, 3D animations** using Shadcn components

```

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Configuration Setup
1. Create prize configuration with customizable prizes, probabilities, and coupon codes
2. Set up animation timing and easing configurations
3. Define color schemes and visual styling variables
4. Configure spin behavior patterns for first/second spins

### Phase 2: Core Wheel Component
1. Create main wheel component with SVG-based segments
2. Implement 3D CSS transforms for realistic wheel appearance
3. Add smooth rotation animations with realistic physics
4. Create segment highlighting and selection logic

### Phase 3: Spin Logic Implementation
1. Develop hook for managing spin states and outcomes
2. Implement predetermined outcomes for first and second spins
3. Add realistic deceleration and stopping animations
4. Create suspense and tension in animations

### Phase 4: Effects and Feedback
1. Implement confetti animation library integration
2. Create slide-down congratulations modal
3. Add sound effects and haptic feedback options
4. Implement coupon code generation and display

### Phase 5: Popup Integration
1. Create popup modal wrapper with timing controls
2. Add easy enable/disable functionality
3. Implement responsive design for mobile/desktop
4. Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### Phase 6: Styling and Polish
1. Apply Shadcn component styling
2. Implement modern 3D effects and shadows
3. Add gradient backgrounds and modern UI elements
4. Optimize animations for performance

## Animation Strategy

### Wheel Design
- **3D perspective**: Use CSS transforms for depth
- **Realistic physics**: Ease-out animations with bounce
- **Visual feedback**: Hover effects and active states
- **Segment highlighting**: Smooth color transitions

### Spin Behavior
- **First spin**: Stop just before the big prize (create tension)
- **Second spin**: Fake stopping at "try again" then continue to win
- **Realistic deceleration**: Multiple revolutions with gradual slowdown

### Confetti Effect
- **Burst pattern**: Radial explosion from wheel center
- **Color coordination**: Match wheel color scheme
- **Duration**: 3-5 seconds with fade-out
- **Performance**: Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation

## Configuration Variables

### Prizes Configuration
```typescript
interface Prize {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  value: number;
  couponCode: string;
  probability: number;
  color: string;
  icon?: string;
}
```

### Animation Settings
```typescript
interface AnimationConfig {
  spinDuration: number;
  easingFunction: string;
  revolutions: number;
  decelerationRate: number;
}
```

### Behavior Patterns
```typescript
interface BehaviorConfig {
  firstSpinOutcome: 'almost_win';
  secondSpinOutcome: 'fake_lose_then_win';
  tensionDelay: number;
  suspenseRevolutions: number;
}
```

## Integration Points

### Landing Page Integration
- Add popup trigger after 5-second delay
- Implement z-index management for overlay
- Add backdrop blur and focus trapping
- Provide easy toggle in environment variables

### Cross-Site Reusability
- Environment-based configuration loading
- Theme integration with existing site colors
- Responsive breakpoint adaptations
- Locale-aware text and currencies

## Testing Strategy
- Component unit tests for spin logic
- Integration tests for popup behavior
- Visual regression tests for animations
- Performance testing for smooth 60fps animations
- Accessibility testing for screen readers

## Performance Considerations
- Use CSS transforms instead of changing layout properties
- Implement will-change hints for animated elements
- Lazy load confetti library only when needed
- Optimize SVG paths and reduce DOM complexity
- Use hardware acceleration for 3D transforms

## Accessibility Features
- ARIA labels for wheel segments and current selection
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader announcements for spin results
- High contrast mode support
- Reduced motion preferences respect

This plan ensures a production-ready, reusable wheel of fortune component that meets all requirements while maintaining high performance and accessibility standards.
