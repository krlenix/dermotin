# Product Information Files

This folder contains simple text files with product information. Just put your product details in plain text format here, and I can read them to help you with:

- Creating product pages
- Writing marketing content
- Generating translations
- Setting up product configurations
- Creating FAQ sections
- Writing product descriptions

## How to Use

1. **Create a text file** for each product (e.g., `fungel-cream.txt`, `dermotin-serum.txt`)
2. **Write product information** in any format you like - bullet points, paragraphs, whatever is easiest
3. **Tell me the filename** and I'll read it to understand your product
4. **I'll help you** create all the website content based on that information

## Example

Create a file like `docs/products/your-product.txt` with content like:

```
